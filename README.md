🎮 Week 7: DOM, Events & Memory Power
Welcome to Week 7 of my SIGMA 8.0 journey with Apna College!
This week, I took a big leap — learning how to interact with the DOM, respond to user events, and build mini-games that test memory and logic.

🌟 What I Explored
🔸 DOM Selection – Using getElementById, querySelector, and traversing elements
🔸 Manipulating Content & Attributes – Dynamically adding/removing elements, using innerText, classList, setAttribute
🔸 Event Listeners – Listening to user actions like click, mouseenter, keydown, input, etc.
🔸 Form Events – change, input, and form submission tracking
🔸 Call Stack – Understood how JavaScript executes code step-by-step
🔸 Promises & Chaining – Wrote cleaner async flows
🔸 Event Bubbling – Learned how events propagate and how to manage them

🛠️ Hands-on Projects
🎨 Random Color Generator
Click the button to change the background color randomly — a fun way to practice DOM manipulation.

🧠 Simon Game (No Sound)
A memory-based game that strengthens logic & sequencing:
1️⃣ A light/button pattern appears
2️⃣ You repeat it
3️⃣ The sequence gets longer each round
4️⃣ One mistake? Game over
5️⃣ Your score = your memory power

🔭 What’s Next?
Next week, I'm diving into async functions and working with real-world APIs — ready to build apps that fetch, display, and update real-time data! 🌐
